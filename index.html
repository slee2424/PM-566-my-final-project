<h4>Data description</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Lipotoxicity: lipotoxicity is a metabolic syndrome that results from the accumulation of lipid intermediates in non-adipose tissue, leading to cellular dysfunction and death.</p></li>
<li><p>Glucose: blood glucose level is the concentration of glucose present in the blood.</p></li>
<li><p>BloodPressure: the pressure of the blood in the circulatory system.</p></li>
<li><p>SkinThickness: skin thickness is primarily determined by collagen content and is increased in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).</p></li>
<li><p>Insulin: insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes glucose uptake.</p></li>
<li><p>BMI: body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</p></li>
<li><p>DiabetesPedigreeFunction: diabetes pedigree function provides “a synthesis of the diabetes mellitus history in relatives and the genetic relationship of those relatives to the subject.” It utilizes information from a person’s family history to predict how diabetes will affect that individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Age: age of the individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Outcome: diabetes diagnosis.</p></li>
